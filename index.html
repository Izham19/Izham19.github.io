<h1> MY EXPERIENCE </h1>
<dl>
  <dt><b>My first job as a salesman.</b></dt> 
  <dd> I have worked as a salesman for my cousin. He's selling a car perfume called 'Fluer'. The perfume got many variety of flavour like apple, honeydew and orange. The best seller is Honeydew flavour. I do this job for about 3 months from 20 July 2020 until 23 October 2020. It is a good experience for me to learning about engaging customers and sell the products. It gave enormous satisfaction to gain something news in my life. </dd>

<dl>
  <dt><b>My second job.</b></dt>
  <dd> I had working at 7evelen about 2 months from 15 November 2020 until 25 January 2021. The unsual experience that I got from working at 7evelen is to have morning and night shift. I usually like to worked at night shift because there are less customers but but have to refrain myself from being sleepy. The advantage working on morning shift is i got to spend more time with my family but i will feel more tired because there are many works to do on morning shift like arrange the goods on the shelves. However, i had not worked long at there because too much energy required when working at convenience store that opens 24 hours.</dd>

<dl>
  <dt><b>My third job as a waiter at Seafood restaurant.</b></dt>
  <dd> After finished my SPM exam, i worked at restaurant named seafood restaurant. My the period I worked there was for 2 months only because i had to do many things, like taking food orders, washing the dining table and washing dishes. It took a lot of my energy because the operating hour start at 5p.m. until 2a.m. where i washing the dishes before i went home. From that moment, i began to understand that finding the money was not an easy thing. I feel very grateful for what I have gained in my life.</dd>
</dl>
<hr striped-border { border: 1px dashed #000; width: 50%; margin: auto; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%; }>
<dl>
  <dt><b>My fourth job as a driver.</b> </dt>
  <dd> Start from february 2021 until now, i become a driver for my sister and grandma. They usually sell cakes and dishes, their customers will order first and we will send it the next day. The cakes that are usually sold are rokok arab and qasidah meanwhile dishes are 'kerutuk ayam' and  'kurma ayam' and 'kuzi ayam'. The surplus side dishes will be sold at the market known as 'Pasar Payang'. My sister and grandma will also take bookings at large quantities from customers. They tend to order more due to the big  occasion like wedding or birthday party.</dd>

<p> This is my father and mother. My father's name is Kamal Jaffry Talib works as a doctor at his jointventure clicic named Klinik Syed Salleh & Rakan-Rakan. He is 58 years old and born at Selangor. My mother's name is Zamila Mohd Ali, aged 56 years old and a teacher at Sekolah Menengah Bukit Payong. She start become a pensioner on June 2020 where she stop teaching at the age of 56 years old.</p>
<img src="img/Family2.jpeg" width="300" height="300">
<p> My first brother worked as a doctor at Hospital Kuantan and his wife worked as a farmasist at Kuantan. My brother's name is Ahmad Firdaus and aged 31 years old meanwhile his wife name is Nor Raihan,aged 27 years old.<br>They got married last year on Jun 2021. They live happily right now as a husband and wife and will get their first child, estimate by doctor around November 2022.<br> The baby will become the first grandson in our family. <br>I am very excited because my parents have waited in a long time for this moment. After scan, the unborn child expect to be a baby boy. </p>
<img src="img/Family4.jpg" width="300" height="300" >
<p> My second brother is a worker at customer survice at Petaling Jaya under FoodPanda Company.<br> My second brother name is Ahmad Faizzudin and aged 29 years old.<br> He had a degree in Law graduated from University Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin. He want to work on other field because law make him stress due to the risk working in that field.<br> He is strict about job where he needs to follow all the rules in that company.<br> He became like that due to the feeling afraid of losing his job.</p>
<img src="img/Family1.jpg" width="300" height="300">
<p> My third brother got a job of Engineer at Moto Company and just got married 2 months ago with Siti Syahira who worked at post office.<br> They known each other at University Tun Hussin Onn where two of them studied before.<br> My third brother name is Ahmad Faez Hafizy,aged 26 years old same age with his wife. My second sister in law is from Batu Pahat, Johor, so it makes sense because they studied in that state for a while.  </p>
<img src="img/Family5.jpg" width="300" height="300">
<p> I am the fourth son of my family. My name is Ahmad Fakrul Izham, aged 22 years old. For diploma, i am studied in banking and graduated in 2020.<br> In addition, i am studying finance for my degree and will ended my degree journey in 2023 which is next year at <abbr title="Universiti Teknologi MARA">UiTM</abbr>.<br> I could say i am the most althetic son in my family because my siblings involve themselves in a one or two specific sport only like football or badminton.<br> I have played football, badminton, volleyball, field race and basketball. I enjoy myself when i am playing sports, i could release all those stress. </p>
<img src="img/Family6.jpg" width="300" height="300">
<p> The fifth son is Ahmad Fitri Daniel who currently studying at USIM, Nilai Negeri Sembilan.<br> He majored in Accounting and has around 1 years to go before him finished the degree. He is 21 years old and as you can see, he's only one year apart from me. So we eventually become close from child until now.<br> The youngest tend to be more pampered and my brother is a little pampered on some occasion like when he want something, kidding and eating.<br> He does not much vegetables, my brother used to got angry when he is a child because he lost playing games with my older brother.<br> He is more mature and can control his anger better right now.
