  <dt><b>My second job.</b></dt>
  <dd> I had working at 7evelen about 2 months from 15 November 2020 until 25 January 2021. The unsual experience that I got from working at 7evelen is to have morning and night shift. I usually like to worked at night shift because there are less customers but but have to refrain myself from being sleepy. The advantage working on morning shift is i got to spend more time with my family but i will feel more tired because there are many works to do on morning shift like arrange the goods on the shelves. However, i had not worked long at there because too much energy required when working at convenience store that opens 24 hours.</dd>

  <dt><b>My third job as a waiter at Seafood restaurant.</b></dt>
  <dd> After finished my SPM exam, i worked at restaurant named seafood restaurant. My the period I worked there was for 2 months only because i had to do many things, like taking food orders, washing the dining table and washing dishes. It took a lot of my energy because the operating hour start at 5p.m. until 2a.m. where i washing the dishes before i went home. From that moment, i began to understand that finding the money was not an easy thing. I feel very grateful for what I have gained in my life.</dd>
