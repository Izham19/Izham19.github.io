<p> My first brother worked as a doctor at Hospital Kuantan and his wife worked as a farmasist at Kuantan. My brother's name is Ahmad Firdaus and aged 31 years old meanwhile his wife name is Nor Raihan,aged 27 years old.<br>They got married last year on Jun 2021. They live happily right now as a husband and wife and will get their first child, estimate by doctor around November 2022.<br> The baby will become the first grandson in our family. <br>I am very excited because my parents have waited in a long time for this moment. After scan, the unborn child expect to be a baby boy. </p>

<p> My second brother is a worker at customer survice at Petaling Jaya under FoodPanda Company.<br> My second brother name is Ahmad Faizzudin and aged 29 years old.<br> He had a degree in Law graduated from University Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin. He want to work on other field because law make him stress due to the risk working in that field.<br> He is strict about job where he needs to follow all the rules in that company.<br> He became like that due to the feeling afraid of losing his job.</p>

<p> My third brother got a job of Engineer at Moto Company and just got married 2 months ago with Siti Syahira who worked at post office.<br> They known each other at University Tun Hussin Onn where two of them studied before.<br> My third brother name is Ahmad Faez Hafizy,aged 26 years old same age with his wife. My second sister in law is from Batu Pahat, Johor, so it makes sense because they studied in that state for a while.  </p>

<p> I am the fourth son of my family. My name is Ahmad Fakrul Izham, aged 22 years old. For diploma, i am studied in banking and graduated in 2020.<br> In addition, i am studying finance for my degree and will ended my degree journey in 2023 which is next year at <abbr title="Universiti Teknologi MARA">UiTM</abbr>.<br> I could say i am the most althetic son in my family because my siblings involve themselves in a one or two specific sport only like football or badminton.<br> I have played football, badminton, volleyball, field race and basketball. I enjoy myself when i am playing sports, i could release all those stress. </p>

<p> The fifth son is Ahmad Fitri Daniel who currently studying at USIM, Nilai Negeri Sembilan.<br> He majored in Accounting and has around 1 years to go before him finished the degree. He is 21 years old and as you can see, he's only one year apart from me. So we eventually become close from child until now.<br> The youngest tend to be more pampered and my brother is a little pampered on some occasion like when he want something, kidding and eating.<br> He does not much vegetables, my brother used to got angry when he is a child because he lost playing games with my older brother.<br> He is more mature and can control his anger better right now.
